Stack Implementation in C++ 🚀
This is a simple implementation of a Stack data structure in C++. It includes basic operations like push, pop, peek, and size.

Features 🌟
Push an element onto the stack.

Pop an element from the stack.

Peek the top element without removing it.

Size of the stack.

Operations 🔧
Push: Adds an element to the top of the stack.

Pop: Removes and returns the top element.

Top: Shows the top element without removing it.

Size: Displays the number of elements in the stack.

Example Usage 💻
cpp
Copy
Edit
Stack S;

S.push(10);    // Adds 10 to the stack
S.push(20);    // Adds 20 to the stack
S.pop();       // Removes 20 from the stack
S.size();      // Returns the current size of the stack
S.top();       // Returns the top element of the stack
Compilation 💻
Save the code as stack.cpp.

Compile using g++ stack.cpp -o stack.

Run the program using ./stack.

Requirements ⚙️
A C++ compiler like g++.
